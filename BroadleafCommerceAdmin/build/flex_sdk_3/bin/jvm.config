# VM configuration
#
# Where to find JVM, if {java.home}/jre exists then that JVM is used
# if not then it must be the path to the JRE itself
#
# If no java.home is specified a VM is located by looking in these places in this
# order:
#
#  1) JAVA_HOME environment variables (same rules as java.home above)
#  2) bin directory for java.dll (windows) or lib/<ARCH>/libjava.so (unix)
#  3) ../jre 
#  4) registry (windows only)
#

java.home=

# Arguments to VM

java.args=-Xmx384m -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false

# Environment variables we care about, whitespace-separated

env=

# java.class.path - use this for adding individual jars or
# directories.  When directories are included they will be searched
# for jars and zips and they will be added to the classpath (in
# addition to the directory itself), the jar to be used in launching
# will be appended to this classpath
 
java.class.path=

# where to find shared libraries, again use commas to separate entries

java.library.path=
