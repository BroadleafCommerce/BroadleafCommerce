/**
 *  The EventPriority class defines constant values
 *  for the <code>priority</code> argument of the
 *  <code>addEventListener()</code> method of EventDispatcher.
 *
 *  <p>The higher the number, the higher the priority of the event listener.
 *  All listeners with priority <code>N</code> will be processed
 *  before listeners of priority <code>N - 1</code>.
 *  If two or more listeners share the same priority,
 *  they are processed in the order in which they were added.</p>
 *
 *  <p>Priorities can be positive, 0, or negative.
 *  The default priority is 0.</p>
 *
 *  <p>You should not write code that depends on the numeric values
 *  of these constants.
 *  They are subject to change in future versions of Flex.</p>
