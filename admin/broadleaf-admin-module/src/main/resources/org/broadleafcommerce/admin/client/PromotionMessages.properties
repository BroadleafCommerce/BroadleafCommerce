bogoHelpContent=<B>Buy One/Get One</B> style offers allows promotion administrators to specify offers that are triggered by detection of a certain quantity of one or more items in the cart. Rules are entered that match any combination of items and a quantity is entered for how many times the rule must match. Also, a subsequent target rule is entered that matches any combination of discount target items in the cart and a quantity. As a result, the system will search for any qualifying items and matching quantities in the cart, and if found, will apply the defined discount to the matched target items and quantities.
