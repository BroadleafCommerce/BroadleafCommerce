     * Stores the file on the filesystem by performing an MD5 hash of the 
     * the staticAsset.fullUrl.
     * 
     * To ensure that files can be stored and accessed in an efficient manner, the 
     * system creates directories based on the characters in the hash.   
     * 
     * For example, if the URL is /product/myproductimage.jpg, then the MD5 would be
     * 35ec52a8dbd8cf3e2c650495001fe55f resulting in the following file on the filesystem
     * {assetFileSystemPath}/35/ec/myproductimage.jpg.
     * 
     * If there is a "siteId" in the BroadleafRequestContext then the site is also distributed
     * using a similar algorithm but the system attempts to keep images for sites in their own
     * directory resulting in an extra two folders required to reach any given product.   So, for
     * site with id 125, the system will MD5 "/site-125" in order to build the URL string.   "/site-125" has an md5
     * string of "7fde295edac6ca7f85d0368ea741b241".    
     * 
     * So, in this case with the above product URL in site125, the full URL on the filesystem
     * will be:
     * 
     * {assetFileSystemPath}/7f/site-125/35/ec/myproductimage.jpg.
     * 
     * This algorithm has the following benefits:
     * - Efficient file-system storage with
     * - Balanced tree of files that supports 10 million files
     * 
     * If support for more files is needed, implementors should consider one of the following approaches:
     * 1.  Overriding the maxGeneratedFileSystemDirectories property from its default of 2 to 3
     * 2.  Overriding this method to introduce an alternate approach
     * 
     * @param fullUrl The URL used to represent an asset for which a name on the fileSystem is desired.
