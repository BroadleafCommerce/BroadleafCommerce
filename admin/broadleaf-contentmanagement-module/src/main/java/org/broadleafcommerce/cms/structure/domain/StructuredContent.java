/**
 * StructuredContent implementations provide a representation of a generic content
 * item with a set of predefined fields.    The fields associated with an instance
 * of StructuredContent are defined by its associated {@link StructuredContentType}.
 * <br>
 * StructuredContent items are typically maintained via the Broadleaf Commerce admin.
 * <br>
 * Display structured content items is typically done using the
 * {@link org.broadleafcommerce.cms.web.structure.DisplayContentTag} taglib.
 * <br>
 * An typical usage for <code>StructuredContent</code> is to display targeted ads.
 * Consider a <code>StructuredContentType</code> of "ad" with fields "ad-image" and
 * "target-url".    This "ad" might show on a websites home page.  By adding
 * <code>StructuredContentMatchRules</code> and setting the <code>priority</code>,
 * different ads could be shown to different users.
 *
 * It would not be typical in a Broadleaf implementation to extend this interface
 * or to use any implementation other than {@link StructuredContentImpl}.
