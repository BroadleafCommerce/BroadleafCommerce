/**
 * Custom Persistence Handlers provide a hook to override the normal persistence
 * behavior of the admin application. This is useful when an alternate pathway
 * for working with persisted data is desirable. For example, if you want to
 * work directly with a service API, rather than go through the standard
 * admin persistence pipeline. In such a case, you can use Spring to inject
 * an instance of your service into your custom persistence handler and
 * utilize that service to work with your entity. The implementation is responsible
 * for converting domain object into the return type required by the admin. Helper
 * classes are passed in to assist with conversion operations.
