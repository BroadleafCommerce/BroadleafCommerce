 * that a valid provider was found for the request, and subsequently not call the default provider. If all registered
 * providers respond with NOT_HANDLED, then the default provider is called. If HANDLED_BREAK is returned, then the
 * provider loop is immediately exited and the default provider is not called.</p>

 * returning HANDLED.</p>
