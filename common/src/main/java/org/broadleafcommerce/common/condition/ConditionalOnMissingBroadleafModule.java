/**
 * <p>
 * Allows for conditional registration of beans depending only if a particular Broadleaf module is absent. By default, this checks for the absence of
 * an implementation entry for a {@link BroadleafModuleRegistration} in {@code spring.factories}.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are 2 options for checking these registrations:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>The type-safe {@link #value()} which assumes that this class is kept up to date with different modules that are added</li>
 *  <li>The {@link #moduleName()} which maps directly to the {@link BroadleafModuleRegistration#getModuleName()}</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * Generally you should use the {@link #value()} attribute to give you a type-safe way to reference the registrations but it is possible
 * that you need to reference a module that has not yet been added to this class. In that case, use the {@link #moduleName()} parameter
 * which allows for more dynamic checking of module names.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the module has not registered itself via {@code spring.factories} then this will always return true.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be used as a composed meta-annotation for module-specific annotations. Example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Target({ ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD })
 * {@literal @}Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 * {@literal @}Documented
 * {@literal @}ConditionalOnMissingBroadleafModule(BroadleafModuleEnum.ACCOUNT)
 * public {@literal @}interface ConditionalOnAccountModule {
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
