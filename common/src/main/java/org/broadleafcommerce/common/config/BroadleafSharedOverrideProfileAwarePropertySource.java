/**
 * <p>
 * Holder for a folder of properties resources comprised of something like the following on the classpath:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>classpath:/runtime-properties/</li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>common.properties</li>
 *     <li>common-shared.properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile].properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile]-shared.properties</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Where the [profile] is a key that is resolved from the current Spring profile. Given that set of properties, they get ordered in the following way, where later files
 * are applied after earlier ones and thus take precedence:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>classpath:/runtime-properties/</li>
 *   <ol>
 *     <li>common-shared.properties</li>
 *     <li>common.properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile]-shared.properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile].properties</li>
 *   </ol>
 * </ul>
 *  
 * <p>
 * Note that this is largely created to support existing Broadleaf implementations for versions older than 5.2. Assuming that you are on Spring Boot, you should look to
 * use {@code application.properties} variants from <a href="http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-boot/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config">
 * the Spring Boot documentation</a>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is generally only a single one of these sources registered in the application, the {@link DefaultRuntimeEnvironmentProfileAwarePropertySource}. If multiple of them
 * are registered, they are ordered based on {@link #getOrder()} and <i>all</i> properties are added to the {@link Environment} prior to moving to the next
 * {@link BroadleafSharedOverrideProfileAwarePropertySource}. To register your own version (again, not necessarily recommended) add this as an entry in a {@code META-INF/spring.factories} file:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * org.broadleafcommerce.common.config.BroadleafSharedOverrideProfileAwarePropertySource=org.broadleafcommerce.common.config.SomeCustomizedProfileAwarePropertySource
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Properties registered via this {@link BroadleafSharedOverrideProfileAwarePropertySource} is functionally equivalent to registering them via {@link PropertySource} and have the same ordering
 * semantics as
 * <a href="http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-boot/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config">"{@literal @}PropertySource annotations on your {@literal @}Configuration classes</a>.
 * An important distinction is that these sources <i>have a higher priority</i> than any {@link PropertySource} annotations on {@literal @}Configuration classes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These are guaranteed to take a higher precedence (and thus override) properties registered via {@link FrameworkCommonClasspathPropertySource}
