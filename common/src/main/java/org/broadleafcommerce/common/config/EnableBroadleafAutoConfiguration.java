/**
 * <b>STOP. This is probably not the annotation you want currently.</b>
 * <p>
 * Broadleaf is progressing towards the Spring Framework's methodology of bean definition and priority. The following
 * are the different phases Broadleaf will progress through with this goal in mind.
 * <p>
 * Phase 1 <i>(current)</i> - Broadleaf framework XML configuration is separated out into {@code site} and {@code admin}
 * specific directories within {@code /blc-config} in at least one module. For this reason, you must use {@link
 * EnableBroadleafAdminAutoConfiguration} and {@link EnableBroadleafSiteAutoConfiguration} for admin and site
 * applications respectively.
 * <p>
 * Phase 2 - <i>Medium level of effort</i> - All Broadleaf modules have had {@link
 * org.broadleafcommerce.common.admin.condition.ConditionalOnAdmin} applied to admin specific beans and the XML
 * configuration files have been moved to just {@code /blc-config}. You can now use {@link
 * EnableBroadleafAutoConfiguration} for both site and admin applications, however it isn't a requirement to migrate
 * {@link EnableBroadleafAdminAutoConfiguration} and {@link EnableBroadleafSiteAutoConfiguration} as they also include
 * root {@code /blc-config} in addition to the {@code admin} and {@code site} specific directories.
 * <p>
 * Phase 3 - <i>Very high level of effort</i> - All framework bean definitions in Broadleaf have been migrated to
 * JavaConfig or annotation based configuration and have applied a Spring Boot Autoconfiguration {@code
 * ConditionalOn...} annotation that defines the condition on which it should be registered. The most common of these
 * will be {@code ConditionalOnMissingBean} which will check if a client application has registered a bean of this type,
 * and if so the framework bean won't get registered. Additionally all Broadleaf module configuration is bootstrapped
 * using {@code spring.factories} which references a {@link org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration}
 * classes that contains {@link org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean} definitions and a {@link
 * org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan} of its entire package to pick up any other beans defined using
 * annotations. The {@link org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration} classes referenced by {@code
 * spring.factories} are discovered by using the Spring Boot Autoconfiguration {@code EnableAutoConfiguration}
 * annotation. Client applications will now be required to migrate to using {@code EnableAutoConfiguration} instead of
 * {@link EnableBroadleafAutoConfiguration}, although this annotation could be modified to compose {@code
 * EnableAutoConfiguration} to mitigate this requirement. When modules are bootstrapped by {@code
 * EnableAutoConfiguration}/{@code spring.factories} those bean definitions are placed in a deferred registration list
 * so they will get registered last, so by the time framework beans are evaluated for registration all client beans that
 * override framework beans have already been registered and the framework bean's {@code ConditionalOnMissingBean}
 * annotation will prevent it from getting registered and consequently overriding the client bean. Also, in order to
 * facilitate commercial framework modules overriding beans defined in community framework modules, the {@link
 * org.springframework.core.annotation.Order} annotation is leveraged in commercial modules with a priority set higher
 * than the default {@link org.springframework.core.Ordered#LOWEST_PRECEDENCE}; this could be simplified by using
 * annotation composition on {@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order} to create something like {@code
 * FrameworkPriority}. At this phase there will be little to no XML configuration remaining in the Broadleaf Framework
 * as XML configuration does not support these conditionals. Also, the use of bean IDs will be severely reduced as they
 * generally aren't required for bean overriding decisions when using {@code ConditionalOnMissingBean}. Bean IDs will
 * still be used for the situations that Spring has defined such as having multiple {@link javax.sql.DataSource} beans
 * all with unique IDs and one marked as {@link org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary} for injections where a
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier} isn't specified.
 * <p>
 * Bootstraps Broadleaf configuration XML using a glob import.
 * <p>
 * This import utilizes the {@link FrameworkXmlBeanDefinitionReader} so that framework XML bean definitions will not
 * overwrite beans defined in a project.
