 * <p>
 * This is a non-functional 5.0 and 5.1-compatible version of this interface that <i>only has functionality in Broadleaf 5.2</i>. This was added into

 * time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A holder for a folder containing a {@code common.properties} file to be added to the Spring {@link Environment} in a programmatic way without Spring Boot and with very specific
 * ordering semantics. This is generally only used within the Broadleaf Framework and supporting modules. This assumes that the location is on the
 * classpath as this drives the creation of a {@link ClassPathResource}. To write your custom one of these, implementations should add an entry to
 * {@code META-INF/spring.factories} like:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * org.broadleafcommerce.common.config.FrameworkCommonClasspathPropertySource=org.broadleafcommerce.common.config.BroadleafCommonPropertySource
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any properties resolved by these classes have a lower precedence than any {@link BroadleafSharedOverrideProfileAwarePropertySource}. However, these have a higher
 * precedence than any {@literal @}PropertySource annotations. Given the ordering mentioned in <a href="http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-boot/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config">this Spring Boot doc</a>
 * properties resolved by these classes come immediately before the {@literal @}PropertySource annotations.
