/**
 * <p>
 * Marker annotation indicating that the current class is both an {@code @Configuration} class
 * <i>and</i> should be executed <i>after</i> any Spring Boot {@link EnableAutoConfiguration}.
 * Classes that are annotated with this are assumed to be imported by {@link PostAutoConfigurationImport}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Classes with this annotation <b>cannot</b> be within a nested {@code @Configuration} class or else
 * it will get picked up too early with the parent {@code @Configuration} class. It must be defined in
 * its own file.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any classes that contains this annotation <b>must</b> be excluded from any component-scans. Corresponding required
 * XML configuration example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <context:component-scan base-package="org.broadleafcommerce.some.package">
 *     <context:exclude-filter type="annotation" expression="org.broadleafcommerce.common.config.PostAutoConfiguration"/>
 * </context:component-scan>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Or in an {@link @ComponentScan} annotation:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}ComponentScan(basePackages = "org.broadleafcommerce.some.package",
 *    excludeFilters = {@literal @}Filter(type = FilterType.ANNOTATION, classes = PostAutoConfiguration.class))
 * }
