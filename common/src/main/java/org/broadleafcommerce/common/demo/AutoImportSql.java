import org.springframework.core.Ordered;

/**
 * <p>
 * Allows a module to specify a sql file and some ordering information to use during Hibernate auto import. This information
 * is traditionally set via the 'hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto' property. However, that method is flat and does not allow
 * easy individual module contribution and special ordering. By using this bean, a module can identify a sql file to
 * import and specify the order it should appear in the cumulative list of all module contributions.
 *
 * <p>
 * In Broadleaf 5.0 and 5.1, this class is non-functional and instead only serves to provide consistent runtime compatibility
 * across Broadleaf 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 in external modules. This class only provides any meaning in Broadleaf 5.2+.
