 * TaskExecutor has been configured.
 * 
 * Asynchronous execution should be used with care.  Events are not durable with this implementation. 
 * In addition, this implementation does not broadcast or multicast events to systems outside of the 
 * running JVM, although an event listener could be configured to do just that.
