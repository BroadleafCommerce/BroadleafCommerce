/**
 * Interface for classes annotated with {@link NamedQueries} and {@link NamedNativeQueries}.
 * Provides a mechanism for creating generic classes for grouping named queries without having to explicitly declare them
 * at the top of individual {@link javax.persistence.Entity} implementation classes.
 * </p>
 * Declaring a query configuration class for the system to harvest named queries from is as simple as making the class implement
 * this interface, implementing the required method(s), and having spring recognize the class as a bean - either through
 * Configuration class, component scanning or xml declaration.
