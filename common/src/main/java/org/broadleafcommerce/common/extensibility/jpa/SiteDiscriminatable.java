/**
 * Used to mark collections for multi-tenancy when the commercial multi-tenant module is loaded. This is only necessary
 * when it's known the collection may contain members from more than one site. The most common case for this is when
 * the containing entity does not belong to a particular site (site discriminator is null) and a number of collection
 * members from different sites reference this containing entity. This is not a common circumstance and this annotation
 * is not normally used. Please note that collections marked with this annotation do not benefit from collection caching.
