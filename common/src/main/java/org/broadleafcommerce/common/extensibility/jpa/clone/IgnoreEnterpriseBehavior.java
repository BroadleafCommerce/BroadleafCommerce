/**
 * Marker annotation for any field on a sandboxable entity that should not undergo enterprise sandbox config validation
 * (if applicable). This has added benefits when marking a collection field on a sandboxable entity:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>When fetched, the collection will behave as a standard Hibernate collection, rather than enforcing enterprise behavior</li>
 * <li>Adds and removals on the collection directly should behave as expected as long as the collection member type is itself
 * not sandboxable</li>
 *</ul>
 * Please note, it is expected when using this annotation on a collection that the collection member type is not sandboxable. Otherwise,
 * persistence of the collection member will itself engage sandbox state and will lead to unexpected results when fetching
 * the collection members.
 * </p>
 * When used according to these guidelines, this annotation can be used to allow an otherwise sandboxable entity to have
 * a non-sandboxable, ToMany relationship to another non-sandboxable entity.
