/**
 * Any module within the BLC framework that needs to store and retrieve files from a remote storage such as
 * Rackspace CloudFiles or AmazonS3 should declare an application file type.
 * 
 * Many (or perhaps even most) implementations will just configure a provider for ALL.   Implementations that deploy to
 * a single file system may use the default FileSystemProvider and not configure anything.  
 * 
 * This enumeration is intended to provide a deployment team with the ability to make granular decisions on how files are 
 * accessed and stored.  
 * 
 * For example, Images might be stored on S3 whereas SiteMap creation might be stored on CloudFiles.   These are just
 * arbitrary examples, but the intent is to give an implementation the ability to alter the storage paradigm based
 * on cost/reliability/performance needs that might vary by file type.
