/**
 * The MetadataNamingStrategy provided by Spring does not allow the usage of JDK dynamic proxies. However, several
 * of our services are AOP proxied for the sake of transactions, and the default behavior is to use JDK dynamic proxies for this.
 * It is possible to cause Spring to use CGLIB proxies instead via configuration, but this causes problems when it is desireable
 * or necessary to use constructor injection for the service definition, since CGLIB proxies require a default, no argument
 * constructor.
 * 
 * This class enhances the behavior of the Spring implementation to retrieve the rootId object inside the proxy for the sake of
 * metadata retrieval, thereby working around these shortcomings.
