/**
 * <p>
 * This is a non-functional 5.0 and 5.1-compatible version of this interface that <i>only has functionality in Broadleaf 5.2</i>. This was added into
 * the 5.0 and 5.1 streams in order to allow 3rd-party integration modules to be compatible with Broadleaf 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 all at the same
 * time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Provides the ability for modules to register themselves with Broadleaf to be used with {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.condition.ConditionalOnBroadleafModule} and {@link ModulePresentUtil}
 * in order to provide different behavior in inter-module dependencies.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Module implementations should be registered in a {@code spring.factories} file like so:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * org.broadleafcommerce.common.condition.BroadleafModuleRegistration=com.broadleafcommerce.mymodule.registration.MyModuleRegistration
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to preserve compile-time checking, additional modules should be added to the {@link BroadleafModuleEnum}. However, if they aren't,
 * this can always be checked at runtime instead by just looking for the String-based module name.
