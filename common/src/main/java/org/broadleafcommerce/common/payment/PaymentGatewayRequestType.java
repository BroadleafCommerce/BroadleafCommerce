/**
 * <p>Gateways/processors support a vast array of different features, and in some cases
 * a single API will perform several different functions based on the state of the request.
 * To fully support this and maintain a consistent API, this extensible enumeration of request types
 * are provided to aid the gateway's implementations determination of the correct request to construct
 * (in the case that the current implementation supports it).</p>
 *
 * For example:
 * 1. Certain gateways support the idea of a "Transparent Redirect" request.
 *    Within that set, only certain ones support the idea of a transparent redirect tokenization only request.
 *    In order to utilize the same {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.payment.service.PaymentGatewayTransparentRedirectService},
 *    a particular request type, (e.g. {@link #CREATE_CUSTOMER_PAYMENT_TR} can be put on the
 *    {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.payment.dto.PaymentRequestDTO} to distinguish which request to construct.
 * 2. Certain gateways support the idea of a "Detached Credit" also referred to as a "blind credit"
 *    In some cases, the gateways implementation utilizes the same "refund" api as a normal credit.
 *    {@link #DETACHED_CREDIT_REFUND} can be passed to an implementation's
 *    {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.payment.service.PaymentGatewayTransactionService#refund(org.broadleafcommerce.common.payment.dto.PaymentRequestDTO)}
 *    method to distinguish what type of refund to construct.
 * 3. Some gateway implementations allow you to pass a manual authorization code received from the bank.
 *    For example, a customer service representative can take orders over the phone and call the bank directly
 *    to get an authorization code for the customer's card. In this scenario, if your gateway supports
 *    this, {@link #MANUAL_AUTHORIZATION} can be passed into an implementation's
 *    {@link org.broadleafcommerce.common.payment.service.PaymentGatewayTransactionService#authorize(org.broadleafcommerce.common.payment.dto.PaymentRequestDTO)}
 *    method to distinguish what type of authorization to construct.
