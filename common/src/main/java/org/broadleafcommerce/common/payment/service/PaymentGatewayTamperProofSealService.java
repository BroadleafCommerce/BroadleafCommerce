/**
 * <p>Several Gateways have a method of communication that uses the HTTP Request/Response model
 * and the client's browser to transmit transaction result information back to the system. In some cases,
 * these gateways don't return a tokenized response, but plain-text parameters.
 * For example: In cases where the application needs to complete an order asynchronously (via a Webhook or SilentPost)
 * we need to send information about the customer id and the order id to the gateway in the original request so that
 * a call back to the server from the gateway will return those values and the system will know how to
 * associate the completed transaction with an order.</p>
 *
 * <p>This mechanism is susceptible to forgery if an attacker wishes to recreate the response result manually.
 * That is, if the attacker knows the endpoint of the callback URL, they can manually change the Customer ID and the
 * Order ID that is returned.</p>
 *
 * <p>Using this service allows the implementor to create a Tamper Proof Seal of the Customer and Order ID
 * using a secret key (one option being the merchant secret key of the gateway).
 * On any web response from a gateway that has plain-text Order ID and Customer ID parameters returned, the
 * verifySeal() method should be called to check if the values have been tampered with.</p>
