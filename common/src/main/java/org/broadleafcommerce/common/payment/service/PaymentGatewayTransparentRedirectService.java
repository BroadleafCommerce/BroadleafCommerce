/**
 * <p>The purpose of this class, is to provide an API that will create

 *
 * <p>Some payment gateways provide this ability and will generate either a Secure Token
 * or some hashed parameters that will be placed as hidden fields on your Credit Card form.
 * These parameters (along with the Credit Card information) will be placed on the ResponseDTO
 * and your HTML should include these fields to be POSTed directly to the
 * implementing gateway for processing.</p>
 *
 * <p>In addition, some gateways also support the creation of a payment token (i.e. a tokenized version of a
 * Credit Card that can be used on subsequent requests) outside the scope of an authorize or sale transaction.</p>
