 * <p>
 * Serves as a bridge class between Hibernate 4.1 and Hibernate 5.2. Designed to map

 * but are named differently.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class was duplicated directly from {@link org.hibernate.annotations.QueryHints} as it contains
 * all of the values from Hibernate 4.1 as well as additional values from Hibernate 5.2.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class should only be used if you need Hibernate 4.1 (Broadleaf 5.2 and below) and Hibernate 5.2 (Broadleaf 6.0+)
 * within the same artifact. This is a stop-gap solution to prevent hard-dependency upgrades within the Broadleaf platform
 * and is not intended to be consumed by Broadleaf users.
