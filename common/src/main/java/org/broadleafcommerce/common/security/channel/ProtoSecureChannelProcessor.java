/**
 * <p>Very similar to the {@link SecureChannelProcessor} except that instead of relying on only the HttpServletRequest this
 * also allows
 * inspection of the X-Forwarded-Proto header to determine if the request is secure. This class is required when the
 * application is deployed to an environment where SSL termination happens at a layer above the servlet container
 * (like at a load balancer)</p>
 * 
 * <p>This is intended to be used in conjunction with the {@link ProtoChannelBeanPostProcessor}. See that class for
 * more information on how to configure.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class encapsulates functionality given in {@link SecureChannelProcessor} so it is unnecessary to configure
 * both</p>
