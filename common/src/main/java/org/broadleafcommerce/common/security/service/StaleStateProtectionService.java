/**
 * This service is responsible for monitoring key changes in state for a given session. If it is detected that a key state
 * change has taken place after the current page was rendered, but before the form on the page is submitted, the service
 * will throw a {@link StaleStateServiceException}, which will result in a Http Status code 409 error response.
 * </p>
 * Examples of key state changes in the admin include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Site switching</li>
 *     <li>Sandbox switching</li>
 *     <li>Catalog switching</li>
 *     <li>profile switching</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * It is important to detect these state changes and prevent stale data submissions in order to prevent data corruption.
 * Such corruption can include entities being associated with incorrect or unintended sites, sandboxes, catalogs and profiles.
 * </p>
 * The classic use case that can expose the problem is to use multiple browser tabs for the admin - all using the same
 * session. Such a configuration can allow a user to expose a product detail form (for example) in one browser tab. Then
 * in a separate browser tab, the user can perform a state switch. Upon returning to the original tab and submitting the
 * form, the data can be persisted in unanticipated ways as it relates to site, sandbox, catalog or profile.
 * </p>
 * This service is disabled by default to guarantee backwards compatibility. However, enabling the service for any installation
 * is relatively easy. First, a property must be seet in the application's property files:
 * </p>
 * {@code stale.state.protection.enabled = true}
 * </p>
 * Second, the applicationContext-admin-security.xml file should be checked for the appropriate filter configuration:
 * </p>
 * {@code
 *      ...
 *       <sec:custom-filter ref="blPreSecurityFilterChain" before="CHANNEL_FILTER"/>
 *        <sec:custom-filter ref="blSecurityFilter" before="FORM_LOGIN_FILTER"/>
 *        <sec:custom-filter ref="blAdminFilterSecurityInterceptor" after="EXCEPTION_TRANSLATION_FILTER"/>
 *        <sec:custom-filter ref="blPostSecurityFilterChain" after="SWITCH_USER_FILTER"/>
 *    </sec:http>
 *   <bean id="blSecurityFilter" class="org.broadleafcommerce.openadmin.web.filter.AdminSecurityFilter" />
 *   ...
 * }
 * </p>
 * Specifically, the "blSecurityFilter" bean and its custom-filter reference config are key here. Note, if present,
 * the "blCsrfFilter" should be replaced with this config, as "blSecurityFilter" encompasses both CSRF protection, as well
 * as the stale state protection described here.
 * </p>
 * Finally, the mechanism of protection is provided by utilizing a state version token. The token is included in the body
 * of each page and represents the current session state for the user. When a key state change event takes place, the state
 * version token is updated in the user session on the server. When the system detects a mismatch between the token provided
 * by a request and the token that exists in the session, the system will emit a {@link StaleStateServiceException}.
