/**
 * <p>Replaces the deprecated {@link BLResourceBundleMessageSource} by using a {@link ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource}
 * instead. The main advantage of using this is the out-of-the-box ability to merge multiple property files together. There
 * is one important difference: When there is a conflict for a property (declared in multiple files) this implementation
 * assumes that the <i>later</i> one in the list takes precedence. This follows with normal Broadleaf assumptions that bean
 * definitions declared later in the merge process win.</p>
 * 
 * <p>While this theoretically supports caching via the features provided in ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource, this should
 * not be used and instead should have cacheMillis always set to -1 (which is the default implementation). This ensures
 * that codes are always obtained from a merged property list.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The basenames in this implementation are Spring path resources so if you need to refer to a resource on the classpath,
 * these should be prefixed with classpath:. This is slightly different from the {@link ResourceBundleMessageSource}; see
 * {@link ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource#setBasenames(String...)} for more information.</p>
