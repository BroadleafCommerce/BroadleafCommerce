/**
 * Utility used for running transactional operations. Streaming operations are interesting because you may want to iterate
 * over a large set of data and perform some work in a transaction. In order to limit transaction times and conserve heap,
 * iterating over the large set should be done in chunks and the level 1 cache should be clear between each chunk. This
 * utility abstracts the creation of chunks and small transactions and level 1 cache clearing so that the caller only need
 * worry about coding the work to be done.
