/**
 * Generic interface that should be used for processing requests from Servlet Filters, Spring interceptors or Portlet
 * filters. Note that the actual type of the request passed in should be something that extends {@link NativeWebRequest}.
 * 
 * Example usage by a Servlet Filter:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   public class SomeServletFilter extends GenericFilterBean {
 *      &#064;Resource(name="blCustomerStateRequestProcessor")
 *      protected BroadleafWebRequestProcessor processor;
 *      
 *      public void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) {
 *          processor.process(new ServletWebRequest(request, response));
 *      }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>Also note that you should always instantiate the {@link WebRequest} with as much information available. In the above
 * example, this means using both the {@link HttpServletRequest} and {@link HttpServletResponse} when instantiating the
 * {@link ServletWebRequest}</p>
