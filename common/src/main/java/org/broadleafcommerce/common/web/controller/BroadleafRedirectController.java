/**
 * This controller works in conjunction with the broadleaf-ajax style redirect.
 * 
 * The logic is quite complex but solves a problem related to redirects and
 * an Ajax form.
 * 
 * It is intended to solve a problem with using an Ajax style login modal 
 * along with Spring Security.
 * 
 * Spring Security wants to redirect after a successful login.   Unfortunately,
 * we can reliably redirect from Spring Security to a page within the BLC 
 * system when the login modal is presented in Ajax.
 * 
 * To solve this problem, Spring Security can be configured to use 
 * the BroadleafWindowLocationRedirectStrategy.   That strategy will add an attribute to 
 * session for the page you want to redirect to if the request is coming in
 * from an Ajax call.    It will then cause a redirect that should be picked 
 * up by this controller.   This controller will then render a page with the
 * blc-redirect-div.    The client-side javaScript (BLC.js) will intercept
 * this code and force the browser to load the new page (e.g. via window.location)
 *
