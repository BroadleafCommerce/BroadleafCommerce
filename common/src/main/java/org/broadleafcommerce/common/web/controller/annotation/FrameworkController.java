/**
 * Indicates that an annotated class is a "Framework Controller" (default MVC controller).
 * <p>
 * This means that if {@link EnableFrameworkControllers} or {@link EnableAllFrameworkControllers} is included in the
 * application configuration then classes annotated with {@link FrameworkController} will be component scanned and
 * included in the application context and that {@link FrameworkMapping}s will be added to handler mappings with a lower
 * priority than {@link org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping}s found within a class annotated with
 * {@link org.springframework.stereotype.Controller}. This priority is achieved through {@link
 * FrameworkControllerHandlerMapping} having a higher order value than {@link RequestMappingHandlerMapping}.
 * <p>
 * The intention is that you are able to specify MVC controllers and mappings within a framework module as the default
 * MVC mappings and a client application can essentially override those mappings without causing an ambiguous mapping
 * exception.
 * <p>
 * The site handler mappings in play in order of precedence from highest to lowest are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link RequestMappingHandlerMapping}</li>
 * <li>{@link FrameworkControllerHandlerMapping}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The admin handler mappings in play in order of precedence from highest to lowest are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link AdminRequestMappingHandlerMapping}</li>
 * <li>{@link FrameworkControllerHandlerMapping}</li>
 * <li>{@link AdminControllerHandlerMapping}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This concept was adapted from {@code @FrameworkEndpoint} from Spring Security OAuth 2.
