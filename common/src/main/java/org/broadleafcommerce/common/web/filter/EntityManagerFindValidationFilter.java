/**
 * <p>
 * Used to validate usages of em.find() when querying for a primary key specifically across sibling Multi-Tenant sites.
 * This Servlet filter should only turned on if you often query an entity by ID. Generally this only happens in
 * API-based use cases since most other use cases rely on querying by name, url, etc and not directly on a primary key.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is intentionally not activated by default but is included here for convenience within other projects. If you are
 * in Spring Boot, this filter can be activated simply in an @Bean method. If you are not using Spring Boot, this
 * filter must come <i>after</i> the {@link BroadleafRequestFilter} and is generally initialized in {@code applicationContext-filter.xml}.
