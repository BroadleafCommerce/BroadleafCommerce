 * This test is intended to test how to override framework bean definitions with a client-level configuration class.
 * In this case the best way to achieve this is to create an inner static Configuration class that defines any bean
 * overrides that need to be prioritized. Then, due to the FrameworkXMLBeanDefinitionReader the beans defined by the
 * inner static class would be prioritized above the beans registered in any @Import or @ImportResource on the outer class.
