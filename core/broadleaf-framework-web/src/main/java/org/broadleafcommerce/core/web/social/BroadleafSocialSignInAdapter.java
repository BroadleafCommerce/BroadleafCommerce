/**
 * The SignInAdapter is exclusively used for provider sign in so a SignInAdapter
 * bean will need to be added to the Spring Social configuration.
 *
 * The signIn() method takes the local application user's user ID normalized as a String.
 * No other credentials are necessary here because by the time this method is called the user will have signed
 * into the provider and their connection with that provider has been used to prove the user's identity.
 * This adapter will then authenticate manually against Spring Security
 *
 * To use:
 * this will automatically be injected into ProviderSignInController,
