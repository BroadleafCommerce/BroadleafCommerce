     * Provides relative URLs.     This is useful for cases where a site wants to 
     * build a dynamic URL to get to a product or category where multiple navigation paths
     * are provided.
     * 
     * For example, consider a product with URL (/equipment/tennis-ball) that is in two categories 
     * which have the following URLs (/sports and /specials). 
     * 
     * For some implementations, it is desirable to have two semantic URLs such as 
     * "/sports/tennis-ball" and "/specials/tennis-ball".
     * 
     * This method will take the last fragment of the product URL and append it to the 
     * passed in URL to make a relative URL.
     * 
     * This default implementation of this interface uses two system properties to control 
     * its behavior.
     * 
     * catalogUriService.appendIdToRelativeURI - If true (default), a query param will be appended to the URL
     * with the productId.
     * 
     * catalogUriService.useUrlKey - If true (default is false), the implementation will call the
     * ProductImpl.getUrlKey() to obtain the url fragment.   If false, it will parse the last part of the 
     * ProductImpl.getUrl(). 
     * 
     * Returns the URL as a string including query parameters.
     *
