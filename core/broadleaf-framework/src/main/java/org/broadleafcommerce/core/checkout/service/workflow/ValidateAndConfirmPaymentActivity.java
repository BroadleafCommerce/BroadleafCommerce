 * <ul>
 * <li>Verify that there is enough payment on the order via the <i>successful</i> amount on {@link PaymentTransactionType.AUTHORIZE} and
 * {@link PaymentTransactionType.AUTHORIZE_AND_CAPTURE} and {@link PaymentTransactionType.PENDING} transactions.</li>
 *
 * <li>"Confirm" any {@link PaymentTransactionType.UNCONFIRMED} transactions that exist on an {@link OrderPayment}. This can
 * mean different things depending on the type of Order Payment and is handled by the {@link org.broadleafcommerce.core.checkout.service.strategy.OrderPaymentConfirmationStrategy}</li>
 * <li>If there is an exception (either in this activity or later downstream) the confirmed payments are rolled back via
 * {@link org.broadleafcommerce.core.checkout.service.workflow.ConfirmPaymentsRollbackHandler}. It will also by default
 * attempt to mark the payment as "ARCHIVED" so that the user may attempt to re-enter their payment details.</li>
