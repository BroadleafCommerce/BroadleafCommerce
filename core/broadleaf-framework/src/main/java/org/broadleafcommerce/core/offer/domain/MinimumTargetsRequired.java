/**
 * This interface can be used with an Offer implementation to indicate that an offer supports minimum required targets.
 * 
 * If set, the offer will not be applied unless the order contains at least the getMinimumRequired() number
 * of eligible targets.
 * 
 * For example, if this was set to 10 and an offer's target criteria was "item in category hot-sauces", then,
 * if the user added 9 hot-sauces to the cart, it would not apply.
 * 
 * If they added 10 or more, it would apply.  
 * 
 * This is different than using the quantity on the OrderItemCriteria.    If the OrderItemCriteria.quantity was
 * set to 10, the discount would be applied only for quantities in increments of 
 * 10 (so yes for 10, 20, etc. but not for 11, 12, etc.)
