/**
 * This indicates how an Offer should be fulfilled to the customer, defaulting to order time discount.
 * Currently, this enumeration can be ORDER_DISCOUNT or FUTURE_CREDIT. "Future credit" means that the associated 
 * adjustment will be discounted at a later time to the customer via a credit. It is up to the implementor to 
 * decide how to achieve this. The adjustment entities have a new "isFutureCredit" field used to determine if an 
 * adjustment originated from an offer marked as FUTURE_CREDIT. Order, OrderItem and FulfillmentGroup have new 
 * accessor methods for retrieving the future credit values when they are needed to be fulfilled. 
 *
 * Out-of-box, this field is disabled from admin and must be manually enabled to view, since it is not a typical 
 * requirement to most implementations. To enable, add the following to AdminConfig.java:
 *
 * @Merge("blAppConfigurationMap")
 * public Map<String, String> adminOfferAdjustmentType() {
 *     Map<String, String> appConfigMap = new HashMap<>();
 *     appConfigMap.put("admin.showIfProperty.offerAdjustmentType", "true");
 *     return appConfigMap;
 * }
