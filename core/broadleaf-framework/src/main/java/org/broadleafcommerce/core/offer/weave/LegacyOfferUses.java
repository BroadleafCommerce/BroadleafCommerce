/**
 * This interface represents an Offer instance that has some additional, deprecated fields related to uses and maxUses
 * 
 * These fields may be showing up as required by the database as they were initially non-nullable.   If you don't have
 * custom logic using these fields, it is safe to remove the fields from your database.
 * 
 * If you do have these fields, this class supports weaving in the legacy fields back into the system.   This should 
 * be done as a last resort with a preference being to remove the columns (or at least the Non-Null restriction) from your
 * DB and refactor any code you have referencing these fields. 
 * 
 * These fields are not currently used by the codebase and have been removed in version 5.0
 * of the framework. However, for backwards compatibility reasons related to the non-nullable "uses" database field,
 * we are allowing these fields to be dynamically re-introduced via a application property. To enable
 * this behavior, add "enable.optional.offer.uses.fields=true" to the appropriate application property files.
