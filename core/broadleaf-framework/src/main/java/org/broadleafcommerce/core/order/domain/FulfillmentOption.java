/**
 * A FulfillmentOption is used to hold information about a particular type of Fulfillment implementation.
 * Third-party fulfillment implementations should extend this to provide their own configuration options
 * particular to that implementation. For instance, a UPS shipping calculator might want an admin user to be
 * able to specify which type of UPS shipping this FulfillmentOption represents.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * This entity will be presented to the user to allow them to specify which shipping they want. A possible
 * scenario is that say a site can ship with both UPS and Fedex. They will import both the Fedex and UPS
 * third-party modules, each of which will have a unique definition of FulfillmentOption (for instance,
 * FedexFulfillmentOption and UPSFulfillmentOption). Let's say the site can do 2-day shipping with UPS,
 * and next-day shipping with Fedex. What they would do in the admin is create an instance of FedexFulfillmentOption
 * entity and give it the name "Overnight" (along with any needed Fedex configuration properties), then create an instance of
 * UPSFulfillmentOption and give it the name "2 Day". When the user goes to check out, they will then see a list
 * with "Overnight" and "2 day" in it. A FulfillmentPricingProvider can then be used to estimate the fulfillment cost
 * (and calculate the fulfillment cost) for that particular option.
 * <br />
 * <br />
 * FulfillmentOptions are also inherently related to FulfillmentProcessors, in that specific types of FulfillmentOption
 * implementations should also have a FulfillmentPricingProvider that can handle operations (estimation and calculation) for
 * pricing a FulfillmentGroup. Typical third-party implementations of this paradigm would have a 1 FulfillmentOption
 * entity implementation and 1 FulfillmentPricingProvider implementation for that particular service.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note: even though the default Broadleaf implementation of this is non-abstract ({@link FulfillmentOptionImpl}),
 * it is very rare that you would actually want to instantiate a raw {@link FulfillmentOptionImpl} rather than using
 * a subclass of this.
