 *  is obtained through their relationship with {@link FulfillmentGroupItem} are summed together</li>
 *  <li>The {@link FulfillmentWeightBand} should be looked up by getting the closest band less

 *  <li>If {@link #getResultAmountType()} returns {@link FulfillmentBandResultAmountType#RATE}, then
 *  the cost for the fulfillment group is whatever is defined in {@link #getResultAmount()}</li>
 *  <li>If {@link #getResultAmountType()} returns {@link FulfillmentBandResultAmountType#PERCENTAGE}, then
 *  the fulfillment cost is the percentage obtained by {@link #getResultAmount()} * retailPriceTotal</li>
 *  <li>If two bands have the same weight, the cheapest resulting amount is used</li>
