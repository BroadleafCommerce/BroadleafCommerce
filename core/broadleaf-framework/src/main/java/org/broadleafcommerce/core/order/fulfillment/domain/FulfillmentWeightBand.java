 * <p>This entity defines the bands that can be specified for {@link BandedWeightFulfillmentOption}. Bands
 * work on the cumulated weight of an {@link Order} and should be calculated as follows:</p>
 * <ol>
 *  <li>The weight of all of the {@link OrderItem}s (via the relationship to {@link Sku}) in a {@link FulfillmentGroup} (which
 *  is obtained through their relationship with {@link FulfillmentGroupItem} are summed together</li>
 *  <li>The {@link FulfillmentWeightBand} should be looked up by getting the closest band less
 *  than the sum of the weights</li>
 *  <li>If {@link #getResultAmountType()} returns {@link FulfillmentBandResultAmountType#RATE}, then
 *  the cost for the fulfillment group is whatever is defined in {@link #getResultAmount()}</li>
 *  <li>If {@link #getResultAmountType()} returns {@link FulfillmentBandResultAmountType#PERCENTAGE}, then
 *  the fulfillment cost is the percentage obtained by {@link #getResultAmount()} * retailPriceTotal</li>
 *  <li>If two bands have the same weight, the cheapest resulting amount is used</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>Note: this implementation assumes that units of measurement (lb, kg, etc) are the same across the site implementation</p>
