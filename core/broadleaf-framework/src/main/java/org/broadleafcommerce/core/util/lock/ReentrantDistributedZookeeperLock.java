/**
 * This is similar to a {@link ReentrantLock}, except that it uses Zookeeper to 
 * share the lock state across multiple nodes, allowing for a distributed lock.  The owning thread may acquire the lock multiple times, but must unlock for each time the lock is 
 * acquired.  It's important to get in the habit of unlocking immediately in a finally block to prevent orphaned locks:
 * 
 * <code>
 * Lock lock = new ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock(zk, "/solr-update/locks", "solrUpdate_commandLock");
 * lock.lockInterruptibly();  //This will block until a lock is acquired or until the Thread is interrupted. 
 * try {
 *     //Do something in a globally locked state
 * } finally {
 *     lock.unlock();
 * }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * or 
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * Lock lock = new ReentrantDistributedZookeeperLock(zk, "/solr-update/locks", "solrUpdate_commandLock");
 * if (lock.tryLock()) {
 *     try {
 *         //Do something in a globally locked state
 *     } finally {
 *         lock.unlock();
 *     }
 * }
 * </code>
 * 
 * In terms of performance, the average lock time, on a single quad-core laptop running a single Zookeeper instance, takes about 7-8 milliseconds. 
 * And the average unlock time also takes around 7-8 milliseconds during a simple test on a quad core laptop that was also running a single Zookeeper instance.
 * This is with a single thread, and is assuming no reentrant locks and no contention or waiting for locks to become available.  
 * In other words, disregarding blocking and contention, it will likely take, on average, 14-16 milliseconds to create and release a lock 
 * (approximately 55-65 locks and releases / second for any given lock). These metrics will depend on a number of things, including contention for locks, 
 * Zookeeper cluster size and configuration, hardware, etc.
