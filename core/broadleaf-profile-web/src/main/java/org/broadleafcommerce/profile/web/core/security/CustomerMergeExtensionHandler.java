     * This allows multiple extensions to modify or copy attributes from the anonymous customer, to the 
     * customer.  The customer is stored on the customerHolder.  If the customer is modified and / or saved to the DB, 
     * the new instance must be reset on the customerHolder.  Each implementation can expect that the result holder will 
     * have the latest version of the customer.  Implementors are not required to save the customer.  
     * It is the responsibility of each implementation to reset the reference.
     * Additionally and alternatively, this method allows for copying and / or modification of the request 
     * attributes from session or request.  Implementors should carefully consider security implications of 
     * copying customer data.  
     * 
     * The anonymous customer may be null.  If the request parameter, the customerHolder parameter, or the customer stored 
     * on the customerHolder is null, then an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.
     * 
     * The return value, generally, should be ExtensionResultStatusType.HANDLED_CONTINUE.  If an implementation wishes 
     * to return an exception in the customerHolder, it should instantiate and set an exception on the customerHolder 
     * and return ExtensionResultStatusType.HANDLED_STOP.
