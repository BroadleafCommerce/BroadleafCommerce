7.  Evaluation Product Additional Terms. If the product you have received with this license has been identified as
    "Evaluation" Software, "Loaned" Software, "Beta" Software or freeware, then the provisions of this section also apply.
    To the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this Agreement,
    this section shall supercede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Evaluation Software, Beta Software,
    or freeware, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. You acknowledge that the Evaluation Software,
    Beta Software or freeware may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and
    data loss. Without prejudice to any other limitations on Broadleaf's liability set forth in this Agreement (which
    shall also apply to Evaluation, Loaned and Beta Software). Evaluation Software, Beta Software, or freeware is provided
    to you "AS-IS", and Broadleaf disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to you of any kind. WHERE LEGAL
    LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, BUT MAY BE LIMITED, Broadleaf'S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS AUTHORIZED PARTNERS SHALL
    BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS (U.S. $1,000.00) IN TOTAL. You acknowledge that Broadleaf has not
    promised or guaranteed to you that freeware or Beta Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the
    future that Broadleaf has no express or implied obligation to you to announce or introduce the Beta Software, and
    that Broadleaf may not introduce a product similar to or compatible with the Beta Software. Accordingly, you
    acknowledge that any research or development that you perform regarding the Beta Software or any product associated
    with the Beta Software is done entirely at your own risk. During the term of this Agreement, if requested by Broadleaf,
    you will provide feedback to Broadleaf regarding testing and use of the Beta Software, including error or bug reports;
    you agree to grant Broadleaf a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, copy, distribute,
    make derivative works and incorporate the feedback into any Broadleaf product at Broadleaf's sole discretion. If
    you have been provided the Beta Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, your Use of the Beta Software
    is also governed by such agreement. Upon receipt of a later unreleased version of the Beta Software or release by
    Broadleaf of a publicly released commercial version of the Beta Software, whether as a stand-alone product or as part
    of a larger product, you agree to return or destroy all earlier Beta Software received from Broadleaf and to abide
    by the terms of the End User License Agreement for any such later versions of the Beta Software. Your Use of the
    Evaluation, Loaned or Beta Software is limited to 30 days and shall expire thereafter; Use of freeware is available
    for only so long as Broadleaf makes the freeware available unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Broadleaf.
    Broadleaf is under no obligation to continue providing freeware or to update such freeware. You shall return
    Evaluation, Loaned and Beta Software and any Documentation at the end of the evaluation or loan period or when
    sooner terminated by Broadleaf for convenience by giving you ten (10) days' written notice, whichever occurs first.
    You shall bear the risk of loss and damage for return of physical media, if any, and de-installation. You may use
    Evaluation Loaned and Beta Software and freeware free of charge, but, in the case of Evaluation Software, solely for
    the purpose of evaluation and not in a production environment. If you are found to be using the Evaluation, Loaned,
    or Beta Software beyond the terms contained in this Section you shall immediately pay Broadleaf a license Fee for
    such software and all terms under this Agreement will be binding. Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by
    Broadleaf, Broadleaf does not provide maintenance or support for any Evaluation Software, Loaned Software or Beta
    Software. YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE EVALUATION, LOANED OR BETA SOFTWARE MAY HAVE DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES WHICH CANNOT
    OR MAY NOT BE CORRECTED BY BROADLEAF. Broadleaf shall have no liability to you for any action (or any prior related
    claims) brought by or against you alleging that your sale, use or other disposition of any Evaluation Software,
    Loaned Software or Beta Software infringes any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right.
    In the event of such an action, Broadleaf retains the right to terminate this Agreement and take possession of the
    Evaluation, Loaned or Beta Software. THIS SECTION STATES Broadleaf'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ALLEGED
    INFRINGEMENTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY EVALUATION SOFTWARE, LOANED SOFTWARE OR BETA SOFTWARE ANY
    PART THEREOF OR OPERATION.

    the Software. If you enter into a contract with a third party in which the third party manages your information
    technology resources ("Managing Party"), you may transfer all your rights to Use the Software to such Managing Party,
    provided that (a) the Managing Party only Uses the Software for your internal operations and not for the benefit of
    another third party; (b) the Managing Party agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
    (c) you provide Broadleaf with written notice that a Managing Party will be Using the Software on your behalf.
    You may not permit third parties to benefit from the use or functionality of the Software via a timesharing,
    service bureau or other arrangement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except
    to the extent the foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law. You may not modify, or create
    derivative works based upon, the Software in whole or in part. You may not copy the Software or Documentation except
    as expressly permitted herein. You may not remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Software. All rights not

9.  Warranty and Disclaimer.
    a.  Limited Warranty. Broadleaf warrants that for sixty (60) days from the date of original purchase the media, if any,
        on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship.
    b.  End User Remedies. Broadleaf's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of
        the foregoing warranty shall be, at Broadleaf's option, either (i) return of the purchase price you paid for the
        license, or (ii) replacement of the defective media in which the Software is contained. You must return the
        defective media to Broadleaf at your expense with a copy of your receipt. This limited warranty is void if the
        defect has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement media will be warranted for the
        remainder of the original warranty period. Outside the United States, this remedy is not available to the extent
        Broadleaf is subject to restrictions under United States export control laws and regulations.
    c.  Warranty Disclaimer. Except for the limited warranty set forth herein, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
        Broadleaf MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO ITS USE OR PERFORMANCE. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR
        TERM THE EXTENT TO WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Broadleaf, ITS SUPPLIERS AND AUTHORIZED
        PATNERS MAKE NO WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, OR TERM (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW,
        CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS,
        MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, INTEGRATION, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY
        FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS
        OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS, Broadleaf MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE
        SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM INTERRUPTIONS OR OTHER FAILURES OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR
        REQUIREMENTS.

10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
    SHALL Broadleaf OR ITS AUTHORIZED PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
    LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR GROSS
    NEGLIGENCE OF ANY Form INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, APPLIANCE FAILURE
    OR MALFUNCTION, OR FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS. IN NO EVENT SHALL Broadleaf OR ITS AUTHORIZED PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE IN EXCESS OF THE PRICE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY, EVEN IF Broadleaf OR ITS AUTHORIZED
    PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation shall not apply
    to liability for death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law prohibits such limitation. Furthermore,
    some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
    limitation and exclusion may not apply to you. Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Broadleaf's liability to
    you for Broadleaf's negligence or for the tort of fraud. Broadleaf is acting on behalf of its suppliers and Authorized
    Partners for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided
    in this Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose. The foregoing provisions shall be enforceable
    to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
