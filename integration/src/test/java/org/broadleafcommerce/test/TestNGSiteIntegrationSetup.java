    /**
     * This was added as a result of update to 7.0 with new spring, hdsqldb, testng, surefire and maybe something else
     * So now spring test framework caches application context and so when some test is starting it will check
     * if needs to create a new context or can use cached. Seems this basically depends on @ContextHierarchy
     * and @ContextConfiguration and maybe their combination. Now we do have some ApplicationContextAware implementations
     * that provide access to a context via static method, so they store it in static variable. Lets assume situation
     * TestA is running, as it is the first application context(lest name it contextA) will be created for it. We have
     * DefaultPostLoaderDao that not only caches context in its static variable but also acts as a singleton and also
     * caches its instance in static variable. If it happens that during TestA run there will be invocation of
     * PostLoaderDao it will have spring context pointing to contextA and PostLoaderDao instance to the one that was get
     * from the contextA. Now TestB is running and let's imaging that new context is created for it. Now PostLoaderDao
     * has application context instance pointing to contextB - beacuse of AppicationContextAware interface, but
     * PostLoaderDao instance is pointing to the one the was created from contextA. The problem here that PostLoader has
     * a references injected and one of them will have a reference to em, and em one way or another will be bound to
     * db connection that in case of in-memory/in-process hsqldb will hold a reference to hsqldb session, that has
     * a reference to database itself.
     * Now test2 does something in transaction, let's say read/query for example. Now inside transaction
     * loader dao is invoked(like DiscreteOrderItem.getSku). In case of transaction is not marked as a
     * readonly and hibernate session flush mode is not set to manual, hibernate will flush and hsqldb session/db
     * will mark tables involved in read as "writing". Now Postloader does findById or whatever query that reference
     * one of the tables that were read in the beginning of the transaction. HSQLDB session/database will check if it
     * has "writing" tables - and it does, it will get associated to corresponding table(sku in this case) hsqldb session
     * And check if the current session and associated are the same, if not it will pause current thread till number
     * of holding "writing lock" tables will not decrement. And because it all happens in one transaction/thread it
     * will hang forever. So this is a defensive mechanism to make sure that application code is always using the
     * lates version of the application context and doesn't have a stale static references. This happens in tests only
     * as in real application there is only 1 context that is created on a startup.
     * <p/>
     * This method is marked as @BeforeMethod because for some reason jenkins(can't reproduce locally) runs it in some
     * sort of parallel way that causing issue with PostLoaderDao - seems it can run method from class A, then method
     * from class B, and then continue to run some other method from class A, so context is bouncing between runs and
     * this can cause that some queries(that are run through PostLoaderDao) return unexpected results - like something not found etc.
