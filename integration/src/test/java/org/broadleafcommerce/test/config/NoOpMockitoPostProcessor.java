/**
 * So, this is a long story and exists as a workaround for a known Broadleaf problem with
 * LTW. This BeanFactoryPostProcessor actually scans every bean definition early to look for
 * appropriate configuration classes for mocks. It is automatically registered as part of "spring-boot-starter-test"
 * artifact inclusion. This ends up loading (but not initializing) any entity class along the way
 * (e.g. a entity class may be mentioned in a @Service class's import block). As a result,
 * our LTW process complains about un-transformed entities.
 *
 * This hack is to disable this post processor, since we don't need @Mock support for this MVC integration test.
 * A longer term fix is to find a earlier integration point for registering class transformers with the
 * ClassLoader during the Spring startup lifecycle.
