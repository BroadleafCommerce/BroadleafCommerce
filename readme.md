BroadleafCommerce is an open-source, eCommerce framework written entirely in Java.

It is targeted at facilitating the development of enterprise-class, commerce-driven sites by providing a robust data and service model, a rich administration platform, and specialized tooling that takes care of core commerce functionality.

To accomplish this goal, we have developed the platform based on the key feature sets required by world-class online retailers and we're committed to continually expanding our feature offering.
